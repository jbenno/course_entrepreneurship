## Description
Interactive media have become the most powerful tools in publishing. The “BAT FAANG” (Baidoo, Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) are defining forces in journalism, entertainment, music, film, and even politics. Seeing interactive media as a business is a key skill to mastering today’s challenges in cultural and political communication.

This course introduces how to draft and plan a startup in interactive media: Define a purpose, see opportunities, challenges and competition, critique existing models, and put together a compelling vision for new media under the conditions of real-world markets, politics, and cultures. The class leads through the phases of building an
interactive media business, starting with the ideation of the product, understanding seeding and bootstrapping the first steps, the rational of venture capital and other sources of financing, and the concept of an exit. The goal is to contribute to forming a critical understanding of current media culture, by thinking and acting like a startup entrepreneur.

## Course Rationale

Rather than looking on the technological or aesthetic side, this course lets students work through the economic and social conditions of interactive media. Entrepreneurship is the mindset to take an active role in shaping the media world. Learning to see interactive media in the light of startup culture provides a frame to understand the mechanics and ideology which defines current media culture and to empower critical discussion of possible alternatives.
